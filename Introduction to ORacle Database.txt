We are going to work on Oracle Database

Oracle database has three things
1.Database Mode
-> If we want to access the database what kind of mode our database need to be
2.DB Logical View
->How we are going to see the data in the database, ( to have some kind of picturization of the data in our mind)
3.DB Objects
-> What are the list of objects can be present in the database

1.Database Mode
->There are three kinds of Mode
    1.Open (or) Read Write Mode: It is accessible to the users, where users can open, read, write in the database
    2.Mount mode: Only DBA can access the database, where DBA can do some maintenance/upgradation/migration activites
    3.Inactive mode: No one can access/use the database, this is where pre-requisites are done before mounting the database    

    Example: Potter man 
        1.Sand/clay is a database which is of no use, --> inactive mode
        2.Clay Pottery, here database is being prepared (like creation,updation,delection etc) for use --> mount Mode
        3.Pot, here database is ready to use -->Open Mode


2.DB Logical View
    ->Here we are going to see the data in the database in a picturized way

Database -> TableSpace -> Segment -> Block

In a large databse, there are table spaces which are logical storage units, 
    then these tablespaces are divided into segments,
        then these segments are divided into blocks.
**The smallest respresentation inside a database is a Block

    Example:Apartments
        1.Apartments, it is like a server, where we have multiple blocks of Apartments i.e, multiple databases are present
        ->>Blocks per apartment i.e, databases per server
        2.In each apartment block, we have floors per block i.e, tablespaces
        ->>Floors per block i.e, tablespaces for database
        3.In each floor, we have multiple flats divided according to the size of the floor i.e, segments
        ->>Flats per floor i.e, segments for Database
        4.In each flat, we have multiple rooms i.e, blocks
        ->>Rooms per flat i.e, blocks for database  

3.DB objects
