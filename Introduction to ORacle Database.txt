We are going to work on Oracle Database

Oracle database has three things
1.Database Mode
-> If we want to access the database what kind of mode our database need to be
2.DB Logical View
->How we are going to see the data in the database, ( to have some kind of picturization of the data in our mind)
3.DB Objects
-> What are the list of objects can be present in the database

1.Database Mode
->There are three kinds of Mode
    1.Open (or) Read Write Mode: It is accessible to the users, where users can open, read, write in the database
    2.Mount mode: Only DBA can access the database, where DBA can do some maintenance/upgradation/migration activites
    3.Inactive mode: No one can access/use the database, this is where pre-requisites are done before mounting the database    

2.DB Logical View

Database -> TableSpace -> Segment -> Block
