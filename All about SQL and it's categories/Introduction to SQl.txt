Here We are going to learn about SQL

SQL - Structured Query Language

Categories:
Data Definition Language (DDL)
Data Manipulation Language (DML)
Transaction Control Language (TCL)
Data Control Language (DCL)
Data Retrieval Language (DRL)

1. Data Definition Language (DDL)
->To define the database objects in a database
    CREATE -> to create new database objects
    ALTER -> to modify the structure of the database objects
    DROP -> to delete the database objects
    TRUNCATE -> to delete all the records from the table ( table blueprint will be present but the data will be deleted)

2. Data Manipulation Language (DML)
->To manipulate the data in the database objects
    INSERT -> to insert the data into the table
    UPDATE -> to update the data in the table
    DELETE -> to delete the data from the table 
    ( in case of delete the data will be deleted permanently from the table, 
    but in case of truncate all the data will be deleted but the table blueprint will be present,
    here in delete only selected data will be deleted but in truncate all the data will be deleted)
