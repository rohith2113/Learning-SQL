Here we are going to discuss to about data types and constraints
** Data is a processed information which consists the following data types

Data types
Char
Varchar2
Integer
Decimal
Date
Timestamp
CLOB
BLOB
BFILE

1. Char && 2.Varchar2
CHAR vs VARCHAR2

( Note: here in the below table, bytes is just used to represent the memory space)
    char                                    Varchar2
1.  Fixed length                            Variable length

2.  Trailing spaces                         No trailing spaces

3.  When char length is 5, no matter the    When varchar2 length is 5, it will 
    value is 1 or 5 or 10, it will occupy   occupy only the space of the value
    5 bytes of memory                       entered but not the whole 5 bytes, 
                                            so if entered value is 1 or 3, it will 
                                            occupy only 1 or 3 bytes of memory                       

4.Accept alphabets only                     Accepts alphabets, numbers and symbols

-> If you know the length of the data and every character is alphabets,
    then use char, it is because it is fixed length and it will occupy
    the same memory space for all the values

3.Integer --> use only whole numbers
4.Decimal - Decimal is represented as Decimal(p,s) where p is precision and s is scale
           Precision is the total number of digits
           Scale is the number of digits after the decimal point
              Ex: Decimal(5,2) --> 123.45
                Decimal(5,2) --> 123.4
                Decimal(5,2) --> 123.00
                Decimal(5,2) --> 123.456 --> error
                Decimal(5,2) --> 1234.5 --> error
                Decimal(5,2) --> 12345 --> error
    ** Scale is exactly considered but precision is more or less considered

5.Number - Number is represented as Number(p,s) where p is precision and s is scale
           Precision is the total number of digits
           Scale is the number of digits after the decimal point
              Ex: Number(5,2) --> 123.45
                Number(5,2) --> 123.4
                Number(5,2) --> 123.00
                Number(5,2) --> 123.456 --> error
                Number(5,2) --> 1234.5 --> error
                Number(5,2) --> 12345 --> error
    ** Scale and precision both are considered

6.Date
DATE - Only Date --> DD-MON-YYYY

7.Timestamp
Timestamp - Date and Time --> DD-MON--YYYY HH:MM:SS:SSSSSS
                                            Hours:Minutes:Seconds:Microseconds

8.CLOB -- Character Large Object
    Ex: Resume
9.BLOB -- Binary Large Object
    Ex: images
10.BFILE -- Binary FIle
    Ex: videos
